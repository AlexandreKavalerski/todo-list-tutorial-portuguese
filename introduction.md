# Introduction

Angular 2 is more than a framework. It's a whole platform for creating applications that can run not only on the browser, but actually anywhere. It gives you tools to easily create dynamic components, define routes, and connect your application to the internet.

In this tutorial you'll learn how to develop a basic application with Angular 2. You will use the building blocks to have a working application: modules, components and services. Angular-CLI will help you in the process in so many ways, and will make the development process much easier. 

By the end of this tutorial you will have a todo-list application, with which you'll be able to add and delete items, and, of course, see all the items in the list.  You will even be able to change the title of an item that's already on the list. 

The list is saved in the browser's local storage. All the changes will remain even when you refresh the browser or even turn your computer off (as long as you use the same browser on the same computer and not in private mode). 

You will even publish the application on the Web, so that other can use it!

After completing this tutorial you are more than welcome to continue developing the application and adding your personal touch. 

This tutorial is meant for beginners. As such it tries to address good practices, but it's not always possible due to its simplicity.

We hope this tutorial helps you in the first stages of Web development with Angular 2! 

Enjoy!
